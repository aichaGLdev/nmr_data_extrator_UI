# nmr_data_extractor_UI

**nmr_data_extractor_UI** is the user interface component of the **nmr_data_extractor** project, developed using **Angular**. It provides an intuitive **multi-stepper interface** that allows users to perform structure elucidation in two ways:

- **Manually**, by filling in the required data step by step.
- **Automatically**, by **uploading an NMR spectroscopic image** that will be processed by the AI model.

The extracted or entered data is then collected and **sent to the backend** for further analysis and molecular structure generation.

## Features

- Multi-stepper interface for structured user input.
- Image upload functionality for automatic processing via AI model.
- Integration with backend for data processing and structure generation.
